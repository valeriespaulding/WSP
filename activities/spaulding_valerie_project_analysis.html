		<h1> Site Intent </h1>
		<p>The site currently has 87 code errors. Our goal is to minimize that to 0, while at the same time condensing the site to 6 pages from 8 by combining the Home page with the About Us page into one page, the Bedroom Furniture page with the Youth Bedroom Page into one page and by combining the Upholstered Furniture page with the Leather Sofa & Love Seats page into one page. Finally we will create an additional Contact Us page with an interactive form to get in touch with the company/submit requests to the company, eliminate the FAQs page and create a Mattresses page. We intend to create a proper design that is appealing to the eye and to list the items available in a more convenient and understandable way making it easier for users to navigate and to find the items that they may be looking for.</p>

			<h1>Targeted Audience</h1>
			<p>From extensive research of all of the competitive sites, our target audience range is females 25 years old to 64 years old with college experience and most not having children, browsing from home. Their workflow process is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to website.</li>
				<li>Research and look for specific item in mind.</li>
				<li>Request for pricing information.</li>
